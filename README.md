Integrating Kubernetes with Okta for user RBAC

Why we need to secure API Server 

The Kubernetes API server is the primary entry point for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster. Securing the API server ensures that only authorized users or services can access and modify resources within the cluster. 

Since the API server is the only part of the Kubernetes cluster that a client can access, it is essential to secure the API server. Unauthorized access to the API server can lead to hijacking of the entire cluster, which also lets an attacker access all secrets and data accessible to the services running on it. 

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is indeed a core feature of Kubernetes that helps control access to resources within a cluster based on roles and permissions. RBAC allows administrators to define fine-grained access policies, specifying who can perform specific actions on which resources.

RBAC primarily deals with authorization, determining what actions a user or service is allowed to perform within the cluster. However, securing the API server encompasses a broader set of security considerations, including:

1)** Authentication: **  RBAC assumes that users or services are authenticated before authorization decisions are made. 
                         This can include various methods such as client certificates, bearer tokens, or integrations with external identity providers like LDAP or OIDC (OpenID Connect).

2) **Transport Security: ** Securing communication between clients and the API server is essential to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or man-in-the-middle attacks.
                            Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption ensures that data exchanged between clients and the API server is encrypted

3)** Auditing and Logging: **Monitoring and logging API server activities are critical for detecting and investigating security incidents, unauthorized access attempts, or policy violations. 

Add Okta details to kube api server and delete and restart the pod

next add oidc configurations in kubeconfig file as below
